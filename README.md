**ABOUT Visual-Studio-gtkmm:**
Visual Studio 2013 projects to build gtk+ and gtkmm and it's dependencies from scrach up to gtkmm.

**HOW-TO:**
```
Before anything go ahead and look on wiki (click wiki link on the right top -> ^ )
Now when you know how to resolve dependencies and in which order to build, you can clone
this repo so that you end up with D:\GitHub\Visual-Studio-gtkmm\ 
this is important because many projects and settings depend on this fixed path!
Once you do so download and extract packages into D:\GitHub\Visual-Studio-gtkmm\projects\
ie. D:\GitHub\Visual-Studio-gtkmm\projects\<extracted-package-name-package-version>.
Once you do so open up Visual Studio solution from msvc-120 folder and follow instructions,
each solution has a "readme file" with information what to do...
More information can be found in "projects" and "properties" folders.
```

You will need following tools installed in path without spaces:
ie. **C:\MyStuff**
```
Windows SDK (recommended to install before Visual Studio)
Visual Studio 2013
CMake
nasm assembler
mozilla-build
Python3
7-Zip (do not use Windows zip, WinRar and such, 7-Zip only!)
```

And also few additional tools:
```
Debugging Symbols
GVim (You definitely do not want to read open source readme files with notepad)
```
