**ABOUT Visual-Studio-gtkmm:**
```
Visual Studio 2013 projects to build gtk+ and gtkmm and it's dependencies.
More information such as dependency graphs and how to use these projects
can be found on wiki, the link on the right.
There are also pre-built binaries for VS in "release" section (link above)
```

**EXTENDING C++ libraries**
```
Initialy I was "heated" to build gtkmm, and the amount of frustration to do so
was not funny at all, sadly that's not enough to make great C++ apps,
So I extended this to networking and cryptography so that we can have an
ALL IN ONE package!
so here you'll will find more than just gtkmm, projects to build Crypto++ and
project templates for Visual Studio including gtkmm, crypto++ and boost.
So that all you have to do is click on File > New > Project
and start coding with latest libraries with 0 setup needed.
